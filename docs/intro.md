# Introduction

You might be wondering: **“Why another tutorial website? Aren’t there enough already?”**  
Fair question. We live in an era of **information overload**—there’s no shortage of tutorials, videos, and guides out there.

So, what makes **DevQuby** different?

## What DevQuby Is About

Our goal isn’t to just give you tutorials or snippets of code. **DevQuby is about building the mindset of an engineer.**  

We want you to learn how to:  
- **Think critically**  
- **Plan effective solutions**  
- **Leverage online resources to solve real problems**  

You won’t find step-by-step “how to build a tic-tac-toe app” guides here. Instead, you’ll learn how to **design the system**, **plan the architecture**, and **find the resources you need to build it yourself**.  

This approach applies whether you want to:  
- Work on real projects  
- Start freelancing  
- Find internships or jobs  
- Build your own SaaS product  

## Why Focus on “Thinking Like an Engineer”?

Because this mindset changes everything. Here’s why:

### 1. **Completely Free**

Programming education has become a huge industry. Many good courses are expensive—and not everyone can afford them.  

**The truth?** You don’t need to spend a single cent to become a great developer today. What you need is the ability to **learn effectively** and **find the right resources**. That’s what DevQuby is here to teach.

### 2. **Future-Proof Skills**

Technology changes fast. A framework that’s hot today might be obsolete in two years.  

By learning how to **think and adapt like an engineer**, you’ll be able to pick up any new technology with confidence.

### 3. **A Problem-Solving Mindset**

Instead of depending on tutorials for every challenge, you’ll learn to:  
- **Analyze problems**  
- **Design solutions**  
- **Implement them independently**  

This is one of the most valuable skills in the real world.

### 4. **The Career Reality**

Here’s a hard truth: **Your degree alone will not prepare you for real-world jobs.**  

Think about it—every year, **hundreds of thousands of students graduate in Computer Science and related fields**, yet only a fraction land good jobs. Why?  

It’s not because the rest didn’t study. Most of them worked hard. The real issues are:  

- **Degrees teach theory, not practice.** You learn algorithms, but rarely how to apply them in real projects.  
- **Problem-solving isn’t taught.** Companies want engineers who can tackle new, unknown problems.  
- **Curriculums lag behind industry.** University syllabuses are often 5–10 years outdated compared to what the market needs.  

The truth is, **your ability to think like an engineer—to plan, analyze, and adapt—is far more valuable than memorizing theory.**  

DevQuby is here to help you build that mindset. When you do, you won’t just aim for a job—you’ll make yourself future-proof.

### 5. **Build Anything You Imagine**

Once you master planning, design, and problem-solving, you’re free.  
You’re no longer limited by tutorials. You can take any idea—an app, a SaaS product, a side project—and bring it to life.

## The Mission

**Our mission is simple:**  
To help you become the kind of software engineer who doesn’t panic when faced with a new challenge—but embraces it with confidence.  

Let’s rebuild your mindset.
