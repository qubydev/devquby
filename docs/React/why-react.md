# What is React?

React is a JavaScript library that helps you build user interfaces for web applications more efficiently than traditional methods. Let's see a quick demonstration.

### 1. Traditional Method

```html
<body>
    <p id="my-text">Not Clicked</p>
    <button id="my-button">Change</button>

    <script>
        const myText = document.getElementById("my-text");
        const myButton = document.getElementById("my-button");

        myButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
            myText.innerHTML = 'Clicked!';
        });
    </script>
</body>
````

While this approach works, you have to manually keep track of the IDs of each element you want to manipulate. On a large web page, this can quickly become overwhelming. React offers a more structured and efficient way to handle UI updates.

### 2. React Method

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function App() {
    const [text, setText] = useState("Not Clicked");

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{text}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setText("Clicked!")}>Change</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

You don't need to worry about the code above, and you don't need to understand it. I'm here to help youâ€”just know this is what React code looks like.

You would almost never (except some special cases) need to keep track of the DOM elements with their id in react.

There is a lot other benifits of using react and we will discuss about everything later on this tutorial, but for now let me show you another really exteresting feature of react.

## React components
You build your own components in react! and then use it as you would have done in plain html.

### 1. Traditional Method
let's say you have a button

```html
<button class="button button-primary button-lg button-outlined">Fancy Button</button>
<!-- If you are familiar with bootstrap or tailwind css libraries you probably know these classes, don't worry if you don't -->
```
Now, how are you going to use this button if multiple place in your page?

```html
<p>check out my fancy button</p>
<button class="button button-primary button-lg button-outlined">Fancy Button</button>

<form>
    <h1>fancy button inside a form</p>
    <button class="button button-primary button-lg button-outlined">Fancy Button</button>
</form>
```

and you keeps repeatinh this everywhere.
But how do we do this in react? let me show you

### 2. React way
Make your own component
```jsx
function FancyButton({children}) {
    return <button className="button button-primary button-lg button-outlined">{children}</button>
}
```

Now you are free to use it anywhere as you would have used a `<button>` tag in your webpage.
```jsx
<p>check out my fancy button</p>
<FancyButton>Fancy Button</FancyButton>

<form>
    <h1>fancy button inside a form</p>
    <FancyButton>Fancy Button</FancyButton>
</form>
```
